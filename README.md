## Sell All
The staple feature of all junk selling addons is the automated selling of Poor quality items. However, Dejunk not only allows you to sell all Poor quality items, it also allows you to sell all items of any quality up to and including Epics.

## Inclusions & Exclusions
Do you consider certain items to be junk no matter the quality and want them to be treated as such? Simply add the items to the Inclusions list and they will always be sold whenever you Dejunk.

Do you have certain items that you never want Dejunk to sell, even if you want it to sell all other items of the same quality? Just add them to the Exclusions list and they will never be sold.

## Automatic Selling & Repairing
Don't want to click the Dejunk button to begin selling your junk each time you open a merchant window? Enable Auto Sell and Dejunk will sell your junk items to a merchant automatically.

Tired of having to manually click a merchant's repair button? Enable Auto Repair and Dejunk will automatically repair all items upon opening a merchant window (prioritizing guild repairs when available).

## Global & Character Specific Settings
Dejunk allows you to quickly switch between global and character specific settings.
